# Python-Hangman-Game

**Description**

The hangman game allows the user to guess a word or letter and if either is incorrect (6 guess allowed) the hangman image changes until the game ends. When the user inputs a text other than "word" or "letter" no penalty is incurred and is prompted for a word or letter selection. When the user inputs a letter already correctly guessed no penalty is incurred and is prompted for a word or letter selection. Incorrect letter guesses are displayed before each letter selection for user convenience, but if the user selects the same letter more than once they are penalized each time. Incorrect word guesses are not displayed based on an assumption of default difficulty and for cleaner game display. 

The program uses two classes (font formatting, random generated hangman words from CSV import) and one function (display hangman image from png imports) in the module AK_A5_Module.

There is a known bug in which the images do not display correctly for the first game. 

There are easter egg words from Terminator and Blade Runner that are not necessarily data science related.
